I was a full-time graduate student at Georgia Tech and graduated in December 2018 (please see the School Experience section for details).

#### Research Fellow at [HackMind](https://hackmind.ai) (2018-01 to 2018-03)

I was a fellow in the initial class at HackMind, a startup incubator in Berlin, Germany. The goal was to create a startup to solve a "moonshot" problem. I gained exposure to the European venture capital environment and startup development, but did not end up forming a company.

#### Senior Software Engineer at [Trainer Road](https://www.trainerroad.com) (2015-12 to 2018-01)

I worked as a member of a small team developing client apps across most major consumer platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, Mac). My focus was on everything from UI to lower-level services like cloud synchronization, local database interaction, and connecting to/interacting with Bluetooth and ANT+ fitness devices. Most of the code was C#, while some of the fitness device code was C/C++, with a bit of Objective C for the iOS app.

This team was heavily focused on independent learners and workers. Individuals were expected to produce rapid, high-quality work, while also not being bashful to reach out to others for assistance when necessary.

#### Member of Industrial Advisory Board at [Oregon Institute of Technology](https://www.oit.edu) (2015-09 to present)

Board member of the IAB for Oregon Tech's Computer Systems Engineering Department. The IAB is the CSET department's conduit to industry, and is a significant contributor to the health and vitality of the three computer/software engineering programs. The IAB provides advice and counsel in the areas of program accreditation, curriculum content, laboratory resources review, career guidance, placement activities, and marketing the programs.

#### Manager of Software Development at [PC-Doctor, Inc.](https://www.pc-doctor.com) (2015-05 to 2015-11)

My role as a manager of software development was an extension of my pre-existing role as a technical lead of the bundle OEM team ('Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead at PC-Doctor, Inc.'). In addition to my prior role, my responsibilities included hiring, technical planning at a staff level for driving corporate objectives, and establishing roadmaps for that development.

#### "Teach Me Something" Developer Talks at [PC-Doctor, Inc.](https://www.pc-doctor.com) (2014-06 to 2015-11)

I kicked off and continued to lead a weekly training series to help developers extend their skill sets. I presented some of the talks, which typically emphasize functional programming topics, distributed computing, or automation. The primary value was in creating a fun, educational forum for debate within the company.

#### Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead at [PC-Doctor, Inc.](https://www.pc-doctor.com) (2013-05 to 2015-05)

I was the technical team lead of our primary OEM bundle products at PC-Doctor. I was responsible for requirements planning, development, and was an active facilitator of communication. Product development on this team largely used C#. Our application was deployed to tens of millions of daily users to run hardware diagnostics, collect data, supported 'hot' updates, and was actively utilized for deploying updates to third-party software. My team was also responsible for running our internal build automation pipeline, primarily using Ant and Jenkins. We released a variety of products under PC-Doctor branding (Toolbox, Service Center, PC-Doctor for Windows), as well as products released under OEM branding. Active installs to maintain were numbered in the tens of millions.

#### Creator of "Highway Route" app (2013-01 to present)

I created the mobile app [Highway Route](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voyagegames.weatherroute) (under the self-licensed moniker Voyage Studios LLC), which provides side-by-side forecasts for travelers along the full extent of their trip. The backend utilizes multiple AWS services (EC2, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc.), while the front end is a Java (Android)/Swift (iOS) client written around an Elm web app with a small AI component. The app currently has over 30,000 active users (all organically grown) and consistently averages greater than 300% annual revenue growth.

An iOS version was launched in 2016: [Highway Weather](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/highway-weather/id1289520390?ls=1&mt=8)

As part of this development, I released a simple [open-source package on Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/forecast-io) for interfacing with the third-party Forecast.io weather service. At one point, the server backend was written in Haskell, although that infrastructure has been deprecated.

#### Software Engineer at [PC-Doctor, Inc.](https://www.pc-doctor.com) (2008-05 to 2013-05)

I was primarily involved in developing diagnostic software for PC hardware using C, C++, and x86 Assembly, with a strong focus on interfacing with system devices and the underlying OS. Quality, robust software was a key goal, as false positives were harmful to the bottom line of our customers. The code modules that I worked on in this role were deployed as elements to most of the products released by the company to millions of end users.

#### Firmware Engineer at [International Game Technology](https://www.igt.com/) (2007-04 to 2008-05)

I developed the software for slot machine games on a gaming platform based on i960 hardware and the C programming language. Development focused on tying various game resources together (graphics, audio, etc.) and verifying that the empirical results of game play adhered to statistical payouts.

#### Web Architect and Technical Advisor for The Life Center (2006-09 to 2007-01)

I worked with a non-profit organization, The Life Center, to develop a website using PHP with a MySQL back-end for presenting information to the public and as the primary portal for conducting TLC's business activities. I was the web architect and developer for the planning, developing, and maintenance of the site. I also served on the Board of Advisors as the primary technology/web advisor.

#### Engineering Intern at [International Game Technology](https://www.igt.com/) (2006-06 to 2006-09)

I was an intern with the Network Application & Systems department at IGT.  I developed an interactive web system for tracking Discretionary Time Off (DTO) of employees from several engineering departments, including checking who was out of the office, requesting time off from an employee's supervisor(s) and supervisor tools for approving and denying DTO. My duties included complete architecture, development, and deployment of the system.

#### IT Intern at [Harry & David Operations](https://www.harryanddavid.com/) (2005-06 to 2005-09)

I was a developer for the redesign of the IT division's intranet website within the Harry & David corporation. These duties included project design, documentation, implementation, and presentation. I then joined a team working on the IT division's internal financial system, which was used to manage projects, resources, and IT financial budgets. My duties included redesign of the site look and feel, implementation of new data reports, bug fixes, and leading the conversion of the site from ASP to ASP.NET.

#### Webmaster at [Oregon Tech's CSET Department](https://www.cset.oit.edu/) (2005-01 to 2007-01)

I was the webmaster and lead developer for Oregon Tech's Computer Systems Engineering Technology department website. My duties involved site maintenance, development using ASP.NET and MS SQL Server to add new features, integrating content, website documentation, and supervising and training other student workers.

#### Distributed Financial Analysis (Hobby Project) (2010 to 2013)

As a hobby project, I built a distributed Haskell project for a variety of financial analyses (primarily, public stock data). This project went through several iterations at various times through off-and-on development, but focused on composability of functionality, distributed computing across many AWS EC2 instances, and predictive analysis. The distributed computing and financial analysis modules were both written by hand, as distributed platforms were not then widely available as a Haskell library.

#### 3D Modeling Program - Software Senior Project (2006-09 to 2007-06)

I developed a simple 3D modeling program for my undergraduate senior project at Oregon Tech, built upon DirectX and Win32 using C++. It allowed model creation, mesh editing, and texture mapping.  The application was designed for easy scalability to include future custom scripting and plugin development. Senior projects at Oregon Tech are solo development efforts. This was an extension of the concepts derived in my 3D Terrain Generation Tool.

#### 3D Terrain Generation Tool (Hobby Project) (2005-11 to 2006-08)

I built a 3D terrain generation tool, as an extracurricular hobby project, using DirectX and C#. The terrain generator featured a visual interface to interact with terrain, a variety of display options to change how the terrain is displayed, and a plug-in system allowing third-party developers to extend the tool. The plug-in system could be used for many things, such as applying vertex and texture modification algorithms, exporting and importing project data into different formats, or for external scripting capabilities (leveraged to support Lua scripting). This was a solo development effort inspired by my interests in 3D modeling. See [this github repo](https://github.com/stormont/terraingine).

#### Team Lead - Software Junior Project (2005-01 to 2005-06)

We developed a graphics engine for use in 3D simulation (games, industrial simulation, etc.). The engine included a dynamic scene graph system, resource management and allocation, and a simple physics/collision system, as well as a real-time rendering engine and networking capabilities. My duties primarily involved 3D engine development using C++ and DirectX, building the scene graph and resource management systems, team coordination, documentation, integration, and presentation.
